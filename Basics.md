# Windows Basics

## First, what is Windows?
Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft that is the main software allowing you to control and use your computer. An operating system (OS) is essential because it manages the computerâ€™s hardware and software resources, lets you run applications, and provides a way for you to interact with the system through windows, icons, and menus (known as a graphical user interface, or GUI). You are most likely running Windows on your computer right now.

## Windows vs other operating systems
Windows, unlike other OS's like Linux and FreeBSD is more graphical focoused; meaning that the user is able to see what they are exactly doing, rather than typing commands in a terminal, even though windows does have a terminal(Command Prompt(cmd) and Powershell).

## What to expect
You are mainly going to see and have to configure:
1. Forensics Questions
2. Unauthorized Users and Administrators
3. Unsecure passwords
4. Unsecure group policy settings
5. Outdated software
6. Malware
7. Unnecessary services
8. Unauthorized media and apps
9. Unsecure apps
10. Misconfigured firewall and antivirus settings


## Familiarity
It is important to get yourself familiar with the operating system. You can do this mainly through:
1. Creating a Windows VM. Try playing around with it.
2. Doing Practice Images. These can realy help with getting familiar with using common apps such as the ones in Microsoft Management Console(MMC).
3. Doing other competitions such as [eCitadel](https://ecitadel.org/) or the [Oklahoma Cup](https://www.okcup.info/). Some of these are state specific, unfortunately.
