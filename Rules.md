## Important rules to know

1. You **CAN NOT** use scripts developed by other competitors or any script designed for the CyberPatriot Competition. Teams from the same school or organization may not collaborate in creating scripts and may not share scripts with each other or other teams.

2. You **CAN NOT** ask for another team's unique identifier (UID).

3. You **CAN NOT** share competition specific information such as vulnerabilities and image contents. This also extends to previous competitions.

4. You **CAN NOT** use large language models or artificial intelligence in helping you with Forensics Questions or Cisco Quizzes.

5. You may use any resource as long as it is free and has not been accessed through monetary means; it must be publicly and reasonably available to all teams, not specifically created for the CyberPatriot competition or any event using CyberPatriot software, not staged online by your team, and not created by other teams, coaches, technical mentors, or team assistants.

6. You **CAN** write your own scripts from scratch during the competition or beforehand, as long as they're original and not shared with others.

7. You **CAN** use official documentation (Microsoft, Ubuntu, Cisco, etc.) and freely available online resources, like guides, and forums.

8. You **CAN** use checklists, notes, or study guides that your **own team** has compiled, as long as they are **not shared across teams**.

Remember: If you think it's against the rules, it probably is.
